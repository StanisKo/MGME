Fate Question flow:

User asks fate question (string) and provides odds and chaos factor (0-10) (0-9)

    |
    v
    Matrix of odds and margins initialized
        |
        |
        |
        v
        Where index of each collection is the int of the odd,
        Index within second-level collection is the chaos factor of adventure
        And each value is an array of 3 ints: lowest margin, target value, highest margin

            |

            v
